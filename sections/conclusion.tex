\section{Conclusion}
In this experiment we successfully generated and characterized polarization entangled photon
pairs using parametric down-conversion process and demonstrated the non-classical nature of the
quantum correlations. By preparing the four Bell states and measuring the coincidence counts, we
observed visibilities and fidelity values that are consistent with the theoretical predictions.
The measured CHSH parameter of $2.385 \pm 0.015$ is greater than the classical limit of 2, which
confirms the presence of quantum correlations in the system. 

Additionally, the state tomography of the generated states was performed and allowerd us to
reconstruct the density matrix of the generated states. Although the experimental imperfections
lowered overall fidelity and purity, the partial transpose of the reconstructed density matrices
were not positive definite, which is a clear indication of entanglement by the PPT criterion.
Overall, these results confirm that the photonic systems provide an accessible platform for
studying quantum correlations and entanglement.
